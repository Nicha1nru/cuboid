I didst take a image of a house, and five winters hence, when mine eyes gazed upon the image once more, the house was vanished.
No hand hath laid upon the image since it was first fashioned. 
It lay undisturbed within a kitchen sink cabinet.
How came this to happen?
7 winters hence the house was burned down.
All 5 inhabitants dead.
0 suspects found.
